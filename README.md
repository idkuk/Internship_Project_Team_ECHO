## 🔍 Project Title

**PromptShield – Prompt Injection Detection in AI Systems**

This project aims to detect and prevent prompt injection attacks in AI models using a rule-based defense tool. Prompt injection is a growing security threat that allows attackers to manipulate large language models (LLMs) through crafted inputs.

## 💡 Summary of Contributions

As part of this internship, my key contributions include:

- 🛠 Tool Development: Created a CLI-based Python tool (PromptShield) that scans prompts and flags potential injection attempts based on known keyword patterns.
- 📊 Testing Dataset: Simulated 50+ prompts across categories like jailbreak, roleplay, override, and benign to validate tool performance.
- 📽 Presentation & Demo: Prepared slide deck, summary, and recorded demo explaining the problem, solution, and real-world relevance.
- 📂 Repository Structuring: Organized all deliverables under Tools, Projects, and Research as per internship requirements.
