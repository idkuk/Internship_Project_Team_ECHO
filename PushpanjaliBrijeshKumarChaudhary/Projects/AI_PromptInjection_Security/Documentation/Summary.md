# 🔐 Summary – AI Prompt Injection Security Project

## 🧠 Project Title
PromptShield: A Rule-Based Tool to Detect Prompt Injection Attacks in AI Systems

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project was to explore, understand, and defend against prompt injection attacks that manipulate the behavior of AI language models. We developed a lightweight Python tool capable of scanning and flagging potentially harmful prompts using a rule-based approach.

## 💡 Problem Statement
As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into daily applications, prompt injection has emerged as a security vulnerability. Attackers craft specific input prompts designed to override system instructions or extract sensitive behavior from AI. Existing systems lack adequate defenses for these manipulations, especially at the input level.

## 🛠 Solution Overview
We designed and implemented a tool — PromptShield — that detects malicious intent within user prompts. It checks input text against a predefined list of high-risk phrases commonly used in jailbreaks, roleplay attacks, and system overrides. The tool provides instant feedback on whether a prompt is clean or potentially dangerous.

## 🧪 Results
- 50+ real and simulated prompts tested
- >80% accuracy in flagging malicious inputs
- CLI version built using Python
- Low false positives on benign queries

## 📈 Real-World Relevance
PromptShield is ideal for developers, researchers, and AI platform providers who need a simple filter layer to catch suspicious inputs before sending them to LLMs. It supports responsible AI usage, especially in sensitive industries like finance, education, and healthcare.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- NLP integration for semantic detection
- Threat scoring based on keyword severity
- Streamlit-based GUI
- API integration for AI model pre-filtering
