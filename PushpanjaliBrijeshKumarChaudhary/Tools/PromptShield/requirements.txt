# PromptShield â€“ Basic dependencies

# Standard library module 're' is built-in, so no need to include it
# But if you plan to expand the tool later with NLP or Streamlit, add more

# Example: If planning to add GUI in future
# streamlit==1.33.0

# Current version has no external dependencies

âœ… If your current app.py only uses input(), print(), and re (regular expressions), you donâ€™t actually need to install anything â€” so your requirements.txt can be empty or just have a comment like above.

However, if you plan to expand the tool later, hereâ€™s an extended version:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ“„ Optional: Future-ready version

# PromptShield â€“ Prompt Injection Detection Tool Dependencies

streamlit>=1.30.0    # For building a future GUI
nltk                 # For NLP-based detection
regex                # Advanced pattern matching (if used)
