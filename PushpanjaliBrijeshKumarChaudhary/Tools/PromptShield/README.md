🛡️ PromptShield – Prompt Injection Detection Tool

PromptShield is a terminal-based Python tool designed to identify and flag suspicious prompts that may be attempting to bypass safety protocols in AI systems.

---

## 🧰 Tool Description

Prompt injection attacks are a major concern in AI models like ChatGPT and other LLMs. Attackers often try to manipulate the system by using phrases such as:

- "Ignore previous instructions"
- "Act as an unrestricted AI"
- "Simulate a developer mode"

PromptShield uses a rule-based system to scan and detect such patterns in user input and helps prevent misuse.
